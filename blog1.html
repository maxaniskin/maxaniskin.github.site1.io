                        <p>Which brings us to the four main principals. Several of the first entrances seemed to involve singing which was too muscular, ‘ommphing’ their voices into the right place rather than caressing – there was no sign of legato for some time. What first attracted Verdi to the story of Il Trovatore was the two female protagonists, Leonora and Azucena – he had wanted to name the opera after Azucena but relented to the name of the play. The first we meet is Leonora performed by American Soprano Leah Crocetto. Her first aria, “Tacea la note placida,” took some time to take off. Crocetto’s voice is impressive in the upper register (and remained so throughout the night, assured on every note) but in some mezza-voce passages the foot seemed to come off the accelerator. As the night proceeded, she grew more and more impressive and the last act especially was a wonder, both vocally and dramatically. When she took poison rather than surrender to the Conte, her acting as the poison took effect too soon was fabulous. And the singing of the final aria, the miserere, followed by the final duet and trio were magnificent; Act IV was a triumph.</p>

                        <p>No less magnificent was Elena Gabouri as Azucena. From the first notes of “Stride la vampa” her voice cut into the house, her high notes were always secure and chilling as required by the drama. Only her costume, an unchanging circus fortune teller with gold pasties complete with tassels, really did detract from the character driven by visions and a desire for vengeance. The costumes of the principals (by Gianluca Falaschi) unfortunately did little to add to character or drama – those of the chorus and actors, by contrast, added character and colour. Azucena’s final duet with Manrico, “Ai nostri monti ritorneremo,” was infinitely touching and projected out into the audience wonderfully</p>
                        <p>South Korean tenor Yonghoon Lee’s voice as Manrico is still a wonder. It became clear before the interval that he was in some physical distress after the spinal injuries he sustained earlier in the year. His movement was restricted and some peculiar stances and gestures seemed to be a product of this. Nonetheless, his voice was thrilling, and, despite the missing of a single high note and the concern this created, he never missed another and was impressive and reliable to the end. His “Ah! si, ben mio” was gorgeous and his diminuendo on the high note of the final duet was exquisite. His artistry and skill at negotiating what was clearly a difficult performance should be respected. Perhaps the audience’s reactions to his second half were heightened by the expectation that something might go wrong once more. Certainly, he received the most generous applause.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>...Russian baritone Maxim Aniskin as the Conte de Luna sang reliably all night, I especially enjoyed the top of his voice. His “Il balen del suo sorriso” was the first real sign of legato on the night and it was sung with great line. He was, however, hampered by having to carry a sword in his left hand for most of the night (there was no scabbard). This reduced his gestures to a single, often claw-like, hand which became a little one-dimensional. He was also not as oily and villainous as he could have been despite all his mafioso trappings and his stalking of his love, Leonora..</p>
